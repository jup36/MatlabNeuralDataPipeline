NOTES on modified NeuroCube code:
----------------------------------
Stored in this directory is only a Matlab version of the
NeuroCube software, which normally resides in NeuroCube/mat folder
of the original code distribution.

1) input data (coordinates of neurons) are read from file 'NeuroCubeInput.txt',
   which is a copy of one of the files
       NeuroCubeInput_M*.txt
   stored in directory 
       Input_cell_coords
2) whether a point source approximation or full spatial model will be used,
   is defined by parameter
       point_source
   defined in files:
       get_phi1.m
   and
       calculate_ampl_spike1.m
3) what spatial models of neurons will be used is determined by
   cell array
       neuron_models
   and parameter
       five_models,
   which are defined in file
       run_simulation.m
4) whether or not the neurons located outside of close vicinity will be used in the
   simulation is determined by parameters
       orig_code
   and
       keep_volume_far,
   which are defined in file
       neurocube.m
   Density of the far neurons is determined by Par_cube.density
5) parameter set for temporal components of models will be still selected at random out of
   five sets
6) whether "original" or constant firing rates will be used is determined
   by parameter
       orig_firing_rates
   defined in file
       neurocube.m
7) Parameters used to generate data are stored in the output file
   by function
       Save_sim_Callback
   defined in the in file
       neurocube.m

Version 1 of fake data employs randomly selected firing rates (like
in the original neurocube software)

In version 2 of fake data the following settings were used:
- diration = 300 sec
- firing rates = 5 (all);
- diameter of electrode = 10 mkm
